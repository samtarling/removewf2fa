(Visually) removes all trace of the WordFence 2FA feature
 
== Description ==
 
WordFence is a *pretty darn good* WordPress plugin, but they recently added two-factor authentication to the free version.

2FA support is **super awesome**, but not when there's no option to turn it off.

Sure, you can just not use it, and for some people that's 100% A-OKAY - but what if you're already using a 2FA plugin? Now you're faced with conflicting user interfaces, users are freaking out and clicking the "wrong 2FA button" and ain't nobody got time for that.

This WordPress plugin removes all *visual* traces of the WordFence 2FA feature from everywhere bar the actual WordFence settings pages (it does however remove the submenu item for "Login Security" under the WordFence admin menu item).
