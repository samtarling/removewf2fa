# Remove WordFence 2FA
WordFence is a *pretty darn good* WordPress plugin, but they recently added two-factor authentication to the free version.

## Why?
2FA support is **super awesome**, but not when there's no option to turn it off.

Sure, you can just not use it, and for some people that's 100% A-OKAY - but what if you're already using a 2FA plugin? Now you're faced with conflicting user interfaces, users are freaking out and clicking the "wrong 2FA button" and ain't nobody got time for that.

## What does it do?
This WordPress plugin removes all *visual* traces of the WordFence 2FA feature from everywhere bar the actual WordFence settings pages (it does however remove the submenu item for "Login Security" under the WordFence admin menu item).
